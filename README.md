# NFV-Fault-Analytics-Basic
 This repository contains several use cases on Telemetry Data for predictive analytics in form of jupyter notebooks.

## Data
  * Netfilter vnf data is used for accuracy comparison between compaction vs orginal data.
  * KPI (key performance indicator) data is used to showcase anomaly detection
  * VNF (netfilter, shorewell, snort) metrics  data is used with key performance indicator( "kpi_anomally.csv") metrics For Cross Layer Fault Signs detection.
  
## Notebook Walkthrough
  * Script is divided into four parts:
    1. Accuracy comparison between compaction vs orignal data (Random Forest)
    2. Anomaly detection (DBScan and AutoEncoder are used)
    3. Cross Layer Fault Signs detection
    4. Spyder Chart visualization for parameters comparison
